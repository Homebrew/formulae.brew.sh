It is meant to\nsupport Wireshark installed from Homebrew or other cases where unprivileged\naccess to macOS packet capture devices is desired without installing the binary\ndistribution of Wireshark.\nThe user account used to install this cask will be added to the access_bpf\ngroup automatically.\n\nYou must reboot for the installation of wireshark-chmodbpf to take effect.\n",
