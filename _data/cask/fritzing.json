To avoid this, you must launch Fritzing\n*from the command-line* for the first time:\n\n  $ /Applications/Fritzing.app/Contents/MacOS/Fritzing\n\nOnce open, you'll need to explicitly update the parts-library:\n\n  Help â†’ Check for updates...\n\nThereafter, at least until the next time you want to update the\nparts-library, you can safely launch it from the Finder.\n\nSee: https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app/issues/3308 for more.\n",
