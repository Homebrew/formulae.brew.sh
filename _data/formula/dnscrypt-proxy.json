  "caveats": "After starting dnscrypt-proxy, you will need to point your\nlocal DNS server to 127.0.0.1. You can do this by going to\nSystem Preferences > \"Network\" and clicking the \"Advanced...\"\nbutton for your interface. You will see a \"DNS\" tab where you\ncan click \"+\" and enter 127.0.0.1 in the \"DNS Servers\" section.\n\nBy default, dnscrypt-proxy runs on localhost (127.0.0.1), port 53,\nbalancing traffic across a set of resolvers. If you would like to\nchange these settings, you will have to edit the configuration file:\n  $(brew --prefix)/etc/dnscrypt-proxy.toml\n\nTo check that dnscrypt-proxy is working correctly, open Terminal and enter the\nfollowing command. Replace en1 with whatever network interface you're using:\n\n  sudo tcpdump -i en1 -vvv 'port 443'\n\nYou should see a line in the result that looks like this:\n\n resolver.dnscrypt.info\n",
